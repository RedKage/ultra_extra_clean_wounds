# Extra. Clean. Wounds.

This is a DoorKickers mod that is merging three different mods:

- __CleanPlay__ from _Splash Friday_  
  Removes paths, go codes, the graphical interface, and everything that is part of the planning phase so you can make Clean replays.

- __Extra Gear__ from _Red Panda_  
  Adds a lot of additional gear like light-sticks, CS gas grenades, secondary weapons in the support slot and much more.

- __Bullet Wounds Enhanced Edition__ from _Red Panda_  
  Leaves corpses and adds more blood. Also adds animated entry wounds on the sprites.

* * *

## Why merging mods?

Because these different mods are overwriting the same files.

So pretty much, if you wanted to have a clean replay, it was working only without any other mods because enabling them would results in conflicts.

Originally I asked _Red Panda_ to merge his Extra Gear mod in _Splash Friday_'s Clean Replay.  
And so he did.

Then, after a few new DoorKickers versions we started to work a bit together, the three of us to maintaining the mod.  
It was then called Extra. Clean. Wounds. which eventually also forked to an Extra. Clean. mod (without the bullet wounds).

I made quite a few videos and got caught up with life and stopped playing DoorKickers for a while.  
When I booted up DK after six months, lots had changed and I wanted to update the whole thing.

But I wasn't accounting for _Red Panda_'s meritorious disappearance and the fact that he had removed 100% of his mods from the steam workshop.  
Wanna know why? Check this [thread out](https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/discussions/-1/598198173703296711/?appid=248610 "Red Panda's Mods").

So I was like, I'm gonna update the mod for my own usage and keep it locally.  
But then I started to merge stuff and I instinctively used GitHub to keep track of the different mods changes.

And so here we are.

## Updates

- Updated for DK v1.0.8

- MK13 flashbang from BagdanM has been added  
  Also known as a "nine-bang"
